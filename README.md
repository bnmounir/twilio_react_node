# Twilio Conversation API for React and Node
**This is an ongoing side project and I can only work on it when I have free time**

---

This project is a demo on how you can leverage/integrate the latest Twilio technology (The Conversation API) to build cross-platform communications. 
I started by building the integration for Web and SMS (MMS under construction)
The API is relatively new and The Twilio Team will add support for more platforms coming in the future as they phase out Chat.

### Reason behind it

While I was building the communication functionality at my job, I noticed a vacuum of information. That's why I decided to share some of what I learned to make it easy for new devs who need this!

Each folder contains its readme file for instructions. 
**Frontend** twilio-react-client
**Backend** twilio-node-server
